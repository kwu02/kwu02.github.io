        <h1>Main characteristics of a PWA (Progressive Web Application)</h1>
        <p>A PWA excels in <strong>responsiveness</strong>, ensuring a seamless user experience across diverse devices.
        responsive design principles enable a PWA to adapt dynamically to different screen sizes,
        eliminating the need for separate development for various platforms. This versatility enables
        users to access the web application from any device with a web browser.</p>
        <p>A PWA provides an <strong>app-like experience</strong> within web browsers, incorporating smooth animations and
        gestures reminiscent of native application. This design choice enhances user engagement and blurs
        the distinction between web and native mobile apps. Users can add the PWA to their home screens,
        further enhancing the immersive and enjoyable interaction.</p>
        <p><strong>Discoverability</strong> is a key strength of a PWA. Unlike traditional apps replying on app stores, A PWA
        is easily found through search engines. This characteristic that paired with the ability to share a
        PWA via URL facilitates user acquisition. Users can distribute the PWA through social media, email,
        or messaging apps.</p>
