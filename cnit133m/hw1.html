    <p>I am a father of two and currently living here in San Francisco with my family. I became interested in computer
        programming and information technology on how to automate and improve business processes after finding myself have
        to spend so much time on manual, repetitive, and redundant tasks at work. My goal is to switch my career to system
        developing and help business improve their processes with technology. I enjoy cycling, hiking, and camping with
        my friends and family whenever possible.</p>

        As cloud computing is becoming more popular, web applications have become an important tool for business. It appears that
        it is far from becoming a good system developer without a solid knowledge of web development. I am taking this class
        and CNIT-133A this semester in order to enrich my knowledge of front-end programming while pursuing the certificate
        in Mobile Web App Development.
