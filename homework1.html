            <p>I am a father of two and currently living here in San Francisco with my family. I became interested in computer
                programming and information technology on how to automate and improve business processes after finding myself have
                to spend so much time on manual, repetitive, and redundant tasks at work. My goal is to switch my career to system
                developing and help business improve their processes with technology. I enjoy cycling, hiking, and camping with
                my friends and family whenever possible.</p>

            <p>I was first introduced to HTML in high school before Google and w3schools.com were launched and when people were using
                dial up internet. With limited resources to support self-learning, any kind of codes scared me away. I wasn't really
                serious about programming until recent years. As cloud computing is becoming more popular, web applications have
                become an important tool for business. It seems to me it is far from becoming a good system developer without any
                knowledge of web development. I am taking CNIT-132 and CNIT-133 this semester to start my path of web development.
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">w3schools.com</a> is my handbook
                for learning programming, it's great resource to learn both front-end and back-end programming.</p>
